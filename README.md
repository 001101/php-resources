## FAQ

### What is PHP, where should I start?

Dear reader, PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
for writing web applications, dynamically generated pages and command line interface scripts. We believe that the best place
to start with PHP is the official website [php.net][php-net] by taking some time and reading the manual. As you pass through
the manual pages you will progress with your knowledge. Use Google search engine for most obvious issues you find. Also reading
[PHP: The Right Way][php-the-right-way] is a very good start for you.
