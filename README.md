## FAQ

### What is PHP, where should I start?

Dear reader, PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
for writing web applications, dynamically generated pages and command line interface scripts. We believe that the best place
to start with PHP is the official website [php.net][php-net] by taking some time and reading the manual. As you pass through
the manual pages you will progress with your knowledge. Use Google search engine for most obvious issues you find. Also reading
[PHP: The Right Way][php-the-right-way] is a very good start for you.


### What is a PHP framework and which one should I use?

Framework is a tool to help you develop faster and better. It is a reusable set of librarires and/or classes. There are many existing,
well established and secure open source frameworks with large communities behind them. Rather than reinventing the wheel many developers
use them to built web applications. There is **NO** official or best PHP framework, because different purposes and different projects require
different tools and approaches. In your career path you will not need to know all of them but you should learn how to use few of the frameworks that
are widely used in industry or are important to you. Before diving into a framework get yourself familiar with some advanced concepts such as OOP,
design patterns, ORM, authentication etc. You are welcome to check the [list of PHP frameworks][list-of-frameworks]. All the most popular
PHP frameworks and all that we have encountered in this group are listed there.
