Many full stack frameworks provide you their own database abstraction approaches or ORMS.

Standalone database abstraction layers and ORMs to check out:

* [Aura SQL](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Sql)
* [Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/)
* [Propel](http://propelorm.org/)
* [RedBeanPHP](http://redbeanphp.com/)
* [ZF2 DB](http://packages.zendframework.com/docs/latest/manual/en/index.html#zend-db)
