Git is one of the most popular free and open source distributed version control
system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed
and efficiency.

Working on code requires a version control system and Git is highly recommended
for versioning PHP code, whether you work on code alone or in a team. It provides
patches, history, rollbacks, code versioning and more for your PHP project as well.
