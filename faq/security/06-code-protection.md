When deploying or selling PHP code you might want to protect and hide it from
a client because of business reasons or the licensing. There are multiple
approaches to check:

* Obfuscation
* Software as a service (SaaS)
* License agreements - the usual approach is to make an agreement and policy with
  clients.
