# Introduction

While developing, there's often a confusion between a `Core PHP Developer` and a `Vanilla/Plain PHP Developer`.
This little Article will tell you the difference between them both to avoid further confusion, so lets get
right into it and describe the differences:

## Core Developer

A `Core PHP Developer` is someone who is actively writing the PHP Language itself and not writing something
in the PHP Language. So a Core PHP Developer writes C Code and extends the PHP Core, which is written in C.

## Vanilla or Plain Developer

A `Vanilla PHP Developer` or `Plain PHP Developer` (Vanilla is preferred) is writing a Website using the PHP
language. So the Vanilla Developer actually uses the language used in the name.

## Conclusion

As long as you are writing PHP Code, you are a `Vanilla PHP Developer` if you are however writing on the PHP Core itself, 
you can be considered a `Core PHP Developer`
