> An anti-pattern is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually
> ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive. The term, coined in
> 1995 by Andrew Koenig, was inspired by a book, Design Patterns, which highlights
> a number of design patterns in software development that its authors considered
> to be highly reliable and effective.
