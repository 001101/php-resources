There are many places for you to find open source PHP libraries that you can use in your code but good and modern PHP libraries
and scripts that follow standards can be found at [http://packagist.org](http://packagist.org). For using packagist libraries you
will have to know how to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Here is also a list of PHP bookmarks for libraries, scripts and code you should know that might be good to check out as well:
[PHP classes](http://phpclasses.org)
[Awesome PHP](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php/)
