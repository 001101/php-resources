Framework is a tool to help you develop faster and better. It is a reusable set of librarires and/or classes. There are many existing,
well established and secure open source frameworks with large communities behind them. Rather than reinventing the wheel many developers
use them to built web applications. There is **NO** official or best PHP framework, because different purposes and different projects require
different tools and approaches. In your career path you will not need to know all of them but you should learn how to use few of the frameworks that
are widely used in industry or are important to you. Before diving into a framework get yourself familiar with some advanced concepts such as OOP,
design patterns, ORM, authentication etc. You are welcome to check the [list of PHP frameworks][list-of-frameworks]. All the most popular
PHP frameworks and all that we have encountered in this group are listed there.
